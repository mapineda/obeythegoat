Recap
Where are we?

We’ve got a form set up to add new items to the list using POST.

We’ve set up a simple model in the database to save list items.

We’ve learned about creating database migrations, both for the test database (where they’re applied automatically) and for the real database (where we have to apply them manually).

We’ve used our first couple of Django template tags: {% csrf_token %} and the {% for ... endfor %} loop.

And we’ve used at least three different FT debugging techniques: in-line print statements, time.sleeps, and improving the error messages.

## TODOS:

* Clean up after FT runs
* Support more than one list
